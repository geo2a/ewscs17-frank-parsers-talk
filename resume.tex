\begin{frame}{Frank programming language}
  Last version presented on POPL'17 in paper Do be do be do by Sam Lindley, Conor McBride, Craig McLaughlin
  \begin{block}{Features}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Eager} evaluation
      \item Algebraic data types
      \item Distinguishing between \emph{values} and \emph{computations}
      \item \emph{Interfaces} --- effects signatures
      \item \emph{Operators} --- effects handlers
      \item Functions are trivial operators that handle no effects
      \item Effects polymorphism based on \emph{ambient ability}
    \end{itemize}
